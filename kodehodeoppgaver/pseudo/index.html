    <header><h1>CSS pseudo elements and how to use them!</h1></header>
    
    <Ul>
    <li>::first-line</li>
    <p class="first">first-line is used as an example here, <br> we have 2 lines and you want to style one of them, you can use first line for this, you could ofcourse also add a span, but i imagine span being worse to use in a big website where you want to use different spans for other stuff</p>
    <li>::first-letter</li>
    <p class="letter">First letter is very self explanatory in that you can use it to style the first letter in something like this unordered list that im typing in right now.</p>
    <li>::before</li>
    <li>::after</li>
    <p>before and after is also quite nice if you want to have something like these emojies you see in the front and after of my list items</p>
    <li>::marker</li>
    <p>marker selects the marker in my list items wich is the dot on the side.</p>
    <li>::selection</li>
    <p class="select">selection is for user of the website only, i will style this line to show deep pink color when selected.</p>
